#### A website for collection of people who want to donate blood on need

In Algeria my home country , blood donations are often done by indviduals because often hospitals don't have enough 
blood to give to those in need , people often tend to use social networks to call for help in case of donations , i built 
this during my spare time to help solve this problem and create a one place where all people can reach each others  and benefit.
